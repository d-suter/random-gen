## 🏁 Getting Started

### For Windows Users:

1. Navigate to the project directory in the Command Prompt or any preferred terminal.
2. Run the `start.bat` file by double clicking it or typing `start.bat` in cmd and pressing `Enter`. 
   - This will install the necessary requirements, start the server, and open the web browser to navigate to the local server address.

### For Linux Users:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Give execute permissions to the script by running: `chmod +x start.sh`.
3. Run the `start.sh` script by typing `./start.sh`.
   - This will do the same as the Windows batch file: install requirements, start the server, and open the website in your default web browser.
